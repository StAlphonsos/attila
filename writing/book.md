# First Glance #

A snark glowered in the window.  Ravens crowed and crowed until the
sun came out, then went away.  All was darkness.  The cats clinked and
clinked as they patted each other with great affection and sharp
claws.

## A Moment ##

A moment in time.  I guess this is literature...

## Another ##

Another sibling moment in time.

# Second Heart #

"Ipsum lorem" cried the potters.

## The Moon ##

Rising, and yet setting.  I'm upside-down.
